Comments already tell some story

call - means calling the predicate and using concluding statements
clause - means the fact was injected into the brain, therefore must be true when it is inserted into the knowledgebase

There are two parts of the logic, one is when the user is trying to insert a new fact, but we also avoid contradicting previous facts and rules
and the one querying fact, where when a user queries something, the machine would be able to correlate from the DB that the data does indeed exist without explicitly stating


FACT INFERENCE AND ASSERTION LOGIC SECTION
- Here is where you identify inference logic when stating a new fact
- MISSING LOGICS: daughter, son, father, mother, grandmother, grandfather

QUERY LOGIC SECTION FOR INFERENCE LOGIC
- This is the logic on how the bot concludes something, given some secondary info that does not explicitly state the predicate
-  MISSING LOGICS: daughter, son, father, mother, grandmother, grandfather
